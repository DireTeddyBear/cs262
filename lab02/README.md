What is the name of the *component* in this application?
	The app has a bunch of UI components, for example Button, FlatList, Text, and several others.

Name one prop and one state element in the code. 
	`birthdays' is a prop element, and `count`is a state element.

How are curly braces ({}) used in the JSX code. 
	Curly braces show that whatever code is inside them is in javascript.

Identify one anonymous function in the code.
	line 16, 'onChangeText={text => setName(text)}'

Does the application, when run on either Android or iOS, use HTML and/or CSS?
	I dont think IOS supports it, and I know that Android doesnt, so no it doesnt use either.
