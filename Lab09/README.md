This code implements a Google Cloud AppEngine application that
integrates a Cloud SQL (Postgresql) database with an Endpoints REST
API. It is deployed to a Google Cloud project that has resources for
AppEngine and Cloud SQL.

Put detailed construction/configuration/use instructions here, including:

1. Set up for the Google Cloud Project (with billing, Cloud SQL, AppEngine, JDBC service?, deactivation/activation) -
Note that the project/billing/DB may have been built in an earlier lab.

2. Lab 9 code overview and deployment instructions (helloWorld, getPlayer & getPlayers) - Note that
they should already know how to clone my sample lab 9 code and commit/push it to their own repo.

3. Homework 3 instructions (putPlayer, postPlayer, deletePlayer)
